### AAU | I should be able to see sol days(duration of a day on Mars),temperature: high and low, sunrise and sunset time and day on Earth is about 24 hours, while a sol (Martian day) is about 24 hours and 40 minutes. So one single sol starts during one Earth day and finishes during the next Earth day. This is the Earth day on current sol at midday.
